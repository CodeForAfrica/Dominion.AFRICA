          HURUmap Land is a joint project of City Press, Rapport, Landbou
          Weekblad and Code for Africa. The data site gives infomediaries like
          journalists and civic activists an easy toolkit for finding and
          embedding interactive data visualizations into their storytelling on
          land ownership in South Africa. The data that informs the land
          ownership debate is often contested and incomplete, We will keep
          sourcing, cleaning and adding data sets to this site, and work towards
          becoming the authoritative data source on this issue.

          HURUmapâ€™s underlying data is quality-checked, from reputable official
          sources including the government Census, PEPFAR and Uwezo. This
          project is build on software originally created by the Knight Lab in
          the U.S.A. for their CensusReporter.org project, which has been
          repurposed by OpenUp and Media Monitoring Africa for Wazimap in South
          Africa and by Code for Africa for HURUmap in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda
          and Zambia.

          Code for Africa and its partners hate seeing civil society or anyone
          else being duped into wasting money unnecessarily on inappropriate
          technology or predatory consultancies.
